<h1>Becky's favorite movies</h1>
<h2>Top 3 of all time!</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Despicable Me 2</h3>
<p>I really love this movie! remains a classic in my watchlist,
     it stands out for me because of its charisma, also, it has Mexico references
      and a truly heartwarming love story between our already known main protagonist Gru, 
      and his job teammate, Lucy.</p>
      <hr/>
<h3>Elemental</h3>
<p>Despise being kinda unpopular for a Disney creation, I really like this movie. 
    There are lots of interesting character designs, the development between our main 
    protagonists seems very realistic and cute to me, kind of a forbidden love, 
    with parents disapproval, and on the top of that, they're not supposed to be together 
    due their physical composition.</p>
    <hr/>
<h3>Belle</h3>
<p>I have never been a fan of 3D anime, but Belle made me realize that not all 3D anime 
    productions have to be cringy. This movie is a whole artwork in all senses, music, 
    graphics, animation, design-wise even!</p>
